Fake Desktop Monitor solution to have multiple screens on Remote desktop of any windows computer

It is of immense importance when you are doing VNC/TEAM VIEWER/ANYDESK/RDP etc to remote computers which do not have physical screens at all or only a few screens connected.

So the solution left with us is either to use dummy HDMI/VGA/DVI port or attach physical screen to the CPU or Laptop.

This solution was developed by https://www.amyuni.com

To use it simply run the batch script as administrator
    setupVirtualDisplay.bat

To create multiple screens Enter 3 repeatedly ,as screens are added one by one and you can only have maximum 4 screens

To remove virtual screens Enter 4 ,and the screens will be removed in the descending order

After adding screens, go to your display settings and change the resolution as per your taste
